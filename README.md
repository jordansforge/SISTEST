SISTEST

This is a VS2015 project.

The back end is WebAPI
The Front end is Angular on the index page of the WebAPI site. 
Run the application and the interface should open in a new window.

There is some commenting in the application.

The unit tests are ther ebut not filled in due to time.


Is not pretty but it works.

With design time it would be layed out better and have better use of containers and other features not implemented here.

Debugging is added but not fully featured yet using Elmah.

There are three sections to the front page.
	- Add a new retrospective ( participants are added by entering a name and clicking add)

	- List all retrospectives
	- Just below that you can enter a date as 12/10/2016 and list all retrospectives for that date

	- Add Feedback to an existing retrospective by referencing its name.

There is a small piece of code that will enter three test cases when you view all the retrospectives but it is comented ou.

There is minimal error checking.
